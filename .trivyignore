# Flow logs ARE enabled through module inputs, but scanners cannot detect module created CloudWatch Log Groups and IAM roles.

# This is a known false positive with vpc module v5.x.

# Public subnets must allow inbound traffic from the internet (HTTP/HTTPS) for an internet facing architecture.

# NACLs intentionally allow public ingress on required ports.

# The ALB is intentionally internet facing and requires inbound HTTP/HTTPS from 0.0.0.0/0.

# Outbound access to 0.0.0.0/0 is intentionally required across multiple tiers:

# - ALB requires unrestricted egress for health checks and AWS service communication.

# - Application instances need outbound internet for OS updates, package installs, API calls, logging, and monitoring agents.

# - Database instances require egress for backups, monitoring, time sync (NTP), and AWS control plane communication.

# These egress rules match AWS best-practice defaults for ALB, EC2, and RDS.
